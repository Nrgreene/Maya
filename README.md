# Maya
a library of my scripting practice tools for Maya
these scripts are for my educational practice in using python for Maya and MEL (Maya Embedded Language) for animation simplification.

These scripts are used to create shortcuts to create a simpler workflow when using Maya for modeling, rigging, and animating.
